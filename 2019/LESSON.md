# How to learn all your lessons in 25 days

Simply put I joined a competition lately, it's called Avent Of Code. I didn't know what it was, and basically it asked you to solve two puzzels every day for 25 days. What I didn't realize is how many mistakes I made during the competition. You just made a mistake, thought you learned your lesson and then made it again next day, and this pattern continues until you realized there's something wrong. 

Without going into too much details of the competition, I'll just state the lessons that I think I learned so far. I don't think I learned them yet, but given another year, I'd like to join the competition to test out my result.

## 1. Refactor your code

I tend to spend similar amount of time drafting solution and refactoring code during (or mostly afterwards). And this continues to be the case for the competition. What surprised me is the degree how important this became. As a matter of fact, I underestimated it.

In short, refactor your code till it reaches its best shape, and make sure the interface precisely written (and documented) and the code is self contained as a function (or a module). 

## 2. Prepare for your battle

## 3. Early bird get the worm

## 4. Use best approach at the moment

## 5. Collect vs Calculate

## 6. Try not to re-inevent

## 7. Curious of others

## 8. If stuck, print your way out

## 9. Patience for details

## 10. Forget and reset
