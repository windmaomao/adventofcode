# How to learn all your lessons in 25 days

I joined a competition lately, it's called Avent Of Code which basically asks you solve two puzzels every day for straight 25 days until the end of year. 

I made quite a bit mistakes during the competition. Right before you think you learned your lesson, it'll prove your wrong in next day competition. This pattern continues until you know there's something wrong with your thinking. 

The following is the list of the lesson.

- 1. Refactor your code
- 2. Prepare for your battle
- 3. Early bird get the worm
- 4. Advance with the best approach at the moment
- 5. Collect vs Calculate, which one is better
- 6. Try not to re-inevent existing algorithm
- 7. Learn from others if you are curious
- 8. If ever stuck, print your way out
- 9. Train your patience for reading details
- 10. Learn how to forget and reset for the day
