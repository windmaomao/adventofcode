# Adevent of Code 2019

This is my first attempt at this competition. Most is written in `Javascript` which is what I use at work. However due to some limitation of the language, the latter half switched to `Ruby` where I can learn from others.  

## Lesson

- No perfect solution at the moment
- Store values first and then compute/collect later
- Don't reinvent simple algorith, choose easy to implement 
- Use brutal force with computer for cheap operation
- Infrastructure framework is required to speed up work
- Custom recursive algorithm can be be very effective
- No need to get perfect solution, move on to next step quickly
- Pay attention to question details, read major part carefully

## Types

H - Hashmap, I - Intcode, P - Position, R - Recursive, F - Filter, M - Math
