## Day 1

Coming back from the thanks giving trip at night, I was curious to know what is Advent Code at around 5:40pm. I joined it with my github account, and finished day 1 with about half a hour. My skillset is pretty rough, spend half time in setting up the infrastracture code, ex. reading the input.

## Day 2

Waked up in the middle of night at 3am, I was excited to checkout day 2. The question was pretty interesting to read and work on, although I'm sure it might be a bit difficult to non-english speaking audience. I finished in about an hour, and was very shocked by how much time I spent on unnecceary thinking and work.

## Day 9

Fully prepared once again to finish day 9 and still spent almost 2 hours. While improving day 5 code (relative simple version of day 7 code), the problem I stuck with 

- Forgot some term from the past days
- Made a mistake in setting address vs value

This time the judge made a first time attempt of ommiting some details and allowing you figure them out. For instance, the third parameter it introduced requires same parameters which is not handled or even revealed by the old version. Lessor learned

- Pay attention to question details, read slow
- Print out key step and make them clear and clean

Though the question is tougher, I managed to hit the ranking around 2000 first time. Also first time I managed to spend very small time (2mins) on part 2.
