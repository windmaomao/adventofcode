### Modal

Map each character as an integer value.

```javascript
const floor = s => s == '('
  ? 1 : -1
```

> In order to convert a list of string (or char) into the models, we can simply apply the `map` as shown in [*Day `0`*](https://medium.com/@windmaomao/kotlin-day-0-dusk-till-dawn-b1696e311181).

### Parse

```javascript
const extractOps = strs => strs
  .split('')
  .map(floor)

const ops = extractOps(read('01')[0])
```

> In order to read a list of string, we refer to `read` utility function defined in [*Day `0`*](https://medium.com/@windmaomao/kotlin-day-0-dusk-till-dawn-b1696e311181).

### Part 1

Starting from position `0`, find out the position after a series of up and down operations. 

```javascript
const part1 = ops => ops
  .sum()
```

> We used a utility `sum` function extending from Javascript ES6, for implementation, please refer to  [*Array*](https://medium.com/@windmaomao/kotlin-day-0-dusk-till-dawn-b1696e311181).

### Part 2

Given a position `-1`, find out how many operations you need to take to get there.

```javascript
const part2 = ops => ops
  .scan(Math.plus, 0)
  .indexOf(-1)
```

The problem is a bit different from the previous `sum`, because we need to keep track of the intermediate result for each step so to know if we reach the destination.

You might wonder why we use `scan` instead of `sum`. The short answer is that `sum` produces `Int` instead of `array`, which prevents us finding a number inside afterwards.

### Highlights

- How to use number to model the stream of data?
- How to use utility functions to solve problems?
