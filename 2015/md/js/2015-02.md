# AoC 2015 Javascript - Day 2

## I Was Told There Would Be No Math

### Modal

Model the `Box` as a list of integer sizes which can be extracted via `Regex`.

```javascript
const extractBox = str => str
  .split('x')
  .map(v => parseInt(v))

const boxes = read('02').map(extractBox)
```

> In order to read a list of string from a file, we refer to `read` utility function defined in [*Day 0*](https://medium.com/@windmaomao/kotlin-day-0-dusk-till-dawn-b1696e311181).

### Part 1

```javascript
const paper = ([l, w, h]) => {
  const base = 2 * l * w + 2 * w * h + 2 * h * l
  const areas = [l*w, w*h, h*l]
  return base + areas.min()
}

const part1 = boxes => boxes
  .map(paperSize)
  .sum()
```

> We used a utility `sum` function extending from Javascript ES6, for implementation, please refer to [*Array*](https://medium.com/@windmaomao/advent-of-code-2015-javascript-array-utility-1b1c4fa8f5c7).

### Part 2

```javascript
const bowSize = ([l, w, h]) => {
  const base = l*w*h
  const edges = [l+w, w+h, h+l]
  return base + edges.min()*2
}

const part2 = boxes => boxes
  .map(bowSize)
  .sum()
```

If you happen to have quite a bit different wrapping methods, it might be worthwhile to come up a function that accept the wrapping method as one of the input variables.

```javascript
const measureBox = fn => boxes => boxes
  .map(fn)
  .sum()

const part1 = boxes => boxes
  .then(measureBox(paperSize))

const part2 = boxes => boxes
  .then(measureBox(bowSize))

```

> We used a utility `then` function extending from Javascript ES6, for implementation, please refer to [*Array*](https://medium.com/@windmaomao/advent-of-code-2015-javascript-array-utility-1b1c4fa8f5c7).
