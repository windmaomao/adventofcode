### Model 

We model a position object as a simple `Int`.  

```kotlin
const dirs = {
  '^': [0, 1], 'v': [0, -1],
  '<': [-1, 0], '>': [1, 0]
}

const extractDirs = strs => strs
  .split('')
  .map(c => dirs[c])
```

Given an instruction `char` and current position `acc`, we can figure out the next position based on the direction it takes.

We lower the dimension to use 1-D coordinates for 2-D layout, hoping it produces quicker coding and simpler understanding for the problem.

### Part 1

```kotlin
const batch = dirs => dirs
  .scan(Math.plusN, [0,0])

const posKey = p => `${p[0]}x${p[1]}`
const uniqSize = dirs => dirs
  .uniqBy(posKey)
  .length

const part1 = dirs => dirs
  .then(batch)
  .then(uniqSize)
```

We `scan` all the instructions to get snapshots of future positions, among them we can find the `distinct` set and the `count`.

> We used a utility `scan` function extending from Javascript ES6, for implementation, please refer to [*Array*](https://medium.com/@windmaomao/advent-of-code-2015-javascript-array-utility-1b1c4fa8f5c7).

### Part 2

We can split the list into two lists with evens in one and odds in another.

```javascript
const part2 = dirs => dirs
  .chunkMod(2)
  .flatMap(batch)
  .then(uniqSize)
```

Each list goes through exactly same  process as in `part1`. In order to get the joint effort from two groups here, we resort to `flatMap` to put two streams back into one stream of data. 

![Flatmap in Real Time](https://miro.medium.com/max/2460/1*_Y63YvBMyq8gnTkO_g3etQ.png)

In the real time , `flatMap` is designed to join multiple streams into one stream according to  element's chronological order. This behavior interestingly mimics the human collaboration pattern very closely.
