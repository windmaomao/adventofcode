You need to construct a binary tree from a string consisting of parenthesis and integers.

The whole input represents a binary tree. It contains an integer followed by zero, one or two pairs of parenthesis. The integer represents the root's value and a pair of parenthesis contains a child binary tree with the same structure.

You always start to construct the left child node of the parent first if it exists.

Example 1:

Input: s = "4(2(3)(1))(6(5))"
Output: [4,2,6,3,1,5]
Example 2:

Input: s = "4(2(3)(1))(6(5)(7))"
Output: [4,2,6,3,1,5,7]
Example 3:

Input: s = "-4(2(3)(1))(6(5)(7))"
Output: [-4,2,6,3,1,5,7]

Constraints:

0 <= s.length <= 3 \* 104
s consists of digits, '(', ')', and '-' only.

```
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
 *     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left)
 *     this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right)
 * }
 */
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {TreeNode}
 */
var str2tree = function(s) {

};
```
