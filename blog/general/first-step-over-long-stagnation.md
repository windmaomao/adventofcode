# First step over long stagnation
Have you ever felt sometime you have to go through a long process of work or time to end up with your first step towards something? You might be wondering if that's because you are getting old. Maybe, and and whatever reason I'm starting to get a lot of these first step moment lately.

## Pick a monitor
For instance, I'm a coder, however I don't keep track of what's going on in the world, especially which computer monitor is better etc. I'm so used to use laptop, but want to pick a monitor to extend my work space.
In general, I'm a bit afraid to go around the world to find out what's best option of monitor available, simply because I don't know where to start the find. And not only I'm overwhelmed by different type of monitor, but also I have to battle with my need at that moment and justify if that is the right move. This process itself wears me out quickly. Although I'm also surprised by the number of new things that I found in the end.
Anyway I'm afraid to accept that I'm not quick enough to catch the trend, of course I was never quick enough, but I felt I was quick back then. So this put me in a bad position of looking for a solution out of many solution that I want to find out.
The end result is that I stayed in a stagnant position for quite a while without moving a foot. Actually the situation isn't bad from the practical point of view, for instance, I'm not using lots of unnecessary resource, but emotionally this is not a good experience, tell you the truth. I felt that I was stuck.

## Breakout
But of course in the end, especially after a long and boiling back and forth, I make a move. Sometimes the move is big and sometimes the move is small, the experience is mixed as well, of course depending on the result. 
From statistically point of view, my big move normally turns out to be not a good one. It normally kicked me back pretty hard due to the misjudge of the reality, destroyed my confidence to try it again, and reverted to my comfortable zone very quickly so that I can feel comfortable again. Of course I can never be that comfortable again thinking of the past experience.

## Small step
Not getting to question myself the frequency of the move, I start to see the importance of the size of the step and its build up. 

- Small in atomic unit
- Can be replaced and built upon
- Can be accumulated over time
- Could potentially avoid cliff

### Atomic
The step needs to be relatively small, the real cost of the step shouldn't jeopardize your daily activity or cause big impact. Not causing big impact seems to be contradicting to your goal, but it happens that the bigger impact adds to the bigger risk especially considering you are making a move after long rest. 

So in short, try something small, if it doesn't make any impact afterwards, at least you can tune it up a little bit. Trust me, never too big, don't ever underestimate the magnitude of step that you are taking. 

### Replace

If you don't like the step you take, as long as it's not causing too much trouble, you'll have plenty of time digesting the ripple effect that it causes. Live with it since you might not care too much, but it'll become part of your life until the point you conclude that ether you like it or hate it. Either way, it's not too much a big deal for you. I'm sure you can handle small change now. 

### Momentum

If it happens that you really like your moves, there'll be pretty quick accumulating them over time, and by then, you might have to make other decisions. If you are not trying to kill yourself, the step should turn out to be all successful. The difference each step makes should be trivial relatively speaking so you might not be watching so close with them, but the final impact of all can be still apparent. 

We want to make a difference in the end, this might be the ultimate goal in the end, reaching there isn't easy, and seems time plays pretty big part in it. And if you rush, normally you have to pay the price.

### Watch cliff

Of course, there's a chance small units never make difference comparing to the larger one, therefore you might still have to bite the bullet of tasting the bigger effect. At least you are giving some time digesting the atomic ones, you are giving all possibilities to live with it long enough, this minimizes your chance of getting surprised later. This also reminds us that we need to watch our momentum closely even when you are making success move. For instance, if you speed up too quickly, it might be common sense to just dial it down a bit before you experiment to dial it up again. 

## Final thoughts

If the process above approves to be useful or practically correct, it might increase our confidence in making new moves, therefore in the end boost the frequency of making them in the future. 

This is my intention of writing this piece, how can I make sure I don't stuck too often? Or at least I don't feel like I'm stuck. 

Maybe it lies in the fact that overall there'll be optimum relationship between the frequency and the size of the move for particular characteristic type of person (or age in general).
