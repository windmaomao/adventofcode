# My Road to become a programmer

I used to be a chemical engineer or at least that was what I was supposed to be since my childhood. However it really didn't work out, instead over the years I like to write stuff with my keyboard, and mostly via a medium that allows me express myself freely.

## Turn

It all started when I took a turn ten years ago, after I worked in a University/Hospital studying cancer. And that wasn't easy, but I need something that cancer research can't provide me, whatever it was. I started to write code and try to make a living doing it without any computer science degree. It wasn't easy, but it wasn't extremely difficult either since as I said coding is meant for me even though most of time I have to worry about my future as well as the potential to survive in a crowd that was not entirely clear to me at that time.

The biggest pain is that even though I was doing it, I never thought at a time I'm a true something, ex. true programmer, with my destination set as becoming a good programmer, that wasn't my goal. Maybe money was partially the goal. So I wasn't really settled, or what you put it, anchored. I'm more like floating...

## Turn 2

Life is getting better in past ten years, not only I started to be writing more code, making more money, I started to lead a team with ten coders for a project. Job security doesn't seem to be a big issue for me any more.

But the stagnation brought by the virus puts things in  another perspective, things seems to be muddy, but at the same time I got more time to experiment, or let's say, more time to really kick off new experimentation on my life style.

Long story short, the end result is that after some fooling-around, I seriously consider to become a programmer, the feeling is much stronger after I got myself a new table, new keyboard, uh another monitor, have been using a laptop for over a year. Basically I got myself a desktop setup,  $`400` in total.

Once these furniture stuff settle in, I put a picture over my desk, and yes, first time in my life, I think I want to be good at doing something. Guess what, I want to be a kicking ass programmer in next five to ten years. That is my goal now. Strangely it's not that I am not good enough, but I want to be better, if not best, in the future.

Over the last ten years, the only thing that builds my passion is the coding, and it's getting even stronger as the time pass by. What stops me thinking that I can become a programmer stopped working somehow during the virus season, so now I'm open to my only destiny which back then I had no way to verify it, nor I was confident enough to pursue it in full strength.

## Turn 3 ?

Muddy as it is, the lesson learned here is that sometimes we have to worry about lots of  things and lots of things might put us in a bad position in the short timeline, but it really have no play if your destiny keep dragging you back once a while. In the long run, you kinda of zigzag and wiggles into this path, but it won't change the matter in the end. What it changes is always the detail, since we pay attention to the detail, therefore the detail does matter. 

One step back, everything matters, but we also should take things easy, one step back, two steps forward, three steps back, they are all relative, overall we should feel happy to make sacrifice so that we can hopefully wiggle back into our own destiny. You have to let time sink in and help you to smooth things out. 

Go fast isn't always better, since it could be muddy most of time, and you could doubt yourself, and also you could miss lots of things. But in the long run, what I learned here is that, you should go as fast as you think you can. It's ok. 

## It's ok.
