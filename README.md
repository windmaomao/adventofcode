# Advent of Code with Javascript
I started `Advent of Code` with `Javascript` at 2019. During the competition, I found `Ruby` very easy to use, so experiment with it that year. At 2020, I looked for a type-safe language, which led me to `Kotlin` in 2015 folder. Later I got interested at `Haskell`, and blended some in 2020 folder.
## Usage for later `Javascript` and `Haskell`
use CodeRunner editor, basically just run it.
## Usage for `Kotlin`
use IntelliJ editor, run test folder.
## Usage for early `Javascript` and `Ruby`
```bash
  npm install
  npm run 2015
  npm start
  npm run 2018-rb
  npm run 2015-rb
```
