# Adevent of Code

Written in `Javascript`, `Ruby` and `Kotlin`.

I started with `Javascript`, since that's my main language. And I joined at 2019, and then went backward towards 2015. Most of early days were coded with it.

During the competition, I read code over the internet, and found `Ruby` very easy to use, and most of the solution made sense to me right away, so I got excited about it and spent some time with it.

Over the time, I looked for a combination of flexibility and type-safe, which led me to `Kotlin` in the end. I started to code it in 2015 folder.

Overall, regardless of the language, the way I programmed here are more or less similar, mostly driven by function, and try to nail each task by one function or sub function or utility function, and hopefully each function can be backed by a unit test.

`Function` controls the workflow, and if it fails to do so, `Class` comes to the picture to iron out the complexity and returns the control back to `Function`. More or less this instills to be the typical process how I approach all problems here.


## Usage for `Javascript` and `Ruby`

```
  npm install
  npm run 2015
  npm start
  npm run 2018-rb
  npm run 2015-rb
```

## Usage for `Kotlin`

use IntelliJ editor, run test folder.
