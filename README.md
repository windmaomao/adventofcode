# Adevent of Code

Written in `Javascript`, `Ruby`, `Kotlin` and `Haskell`.

I started with `Javascript`, half is written with it.

During the 2019 competition, I found `Ruby` very easy to use, therefore spent some time with it.

Over the time, I looked for type-safe, which led me to `Kotlin`. I started to code it in 2015 folder.

After a year also, I get interested in `Haskell`, therefore I started to blend some in 2020 folder.

## Usage for later `Javascript` and `Haskell`

use CodeRunner editor, basically just run it.

## Usage for `Kotlin`

use IntelliJ editor, run test folder.

## Usage for early `Javascript` and `Ruby`

```
  npm install
  npm run 2015
  npm start
  npm run 2018-rb
  npm run 2015-rb
```
