# Adevent of Code 

Written in `Javascript`, `Ruby` and `Haskell`. I started with `Javascript` and then found `Ruby` very easy to use and `Haskell` very inspiring. 

In the end I borrowed what I learned from the above languages and code them in `Javascript` starting Advent of Code 2015.

## Usage 

```
  npm install
  npm run 2015
  npm start
  npm run 2018-rb
  npm run 2015-rb
```
