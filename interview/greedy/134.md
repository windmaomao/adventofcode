# Gas Station

There are N gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at station i is gas[i].

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to travel from station i to its next station (i+1). You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

Return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return -1.

```
 [1,2,3,4,5], [3,4,5,1,2] -> 3
 [2,3,4], [3,4,3] -> -1
```

## Notes

calculate diff

//gas  = [1,2,3,4,5]
//cost = [3,4,5,1,2]
//       -2,-2,-2,3,3

// find a index that right hand side summation is always greater than zero

//         -2
//         -2
//         -2
//          3   > 0
//          3       3+prev > 0

## Code

```javascript
function cycle(gas, cost) {
  const n = gas.length
  const diff = new Array(n).fill(0)
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    diff[i] = gas[i] - cost[i]
  }

  let start = -1
  let sum = 0, sum2 = 0
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    const j = diff[i]
    sum += j
    if (start >= 0) {
      sum2 += j
      if (sum2 < 0) start = -1
    } else {
      if (j >= 0) {
        start = i
        sum2 = j
      }
    }
  }

  return ((start >= 0) && (sum >= 0)) ? start : -1
}

```
