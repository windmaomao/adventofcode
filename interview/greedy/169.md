# Majority Element

Given an array of size n, find the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊ n/2 ⌋ times.

You may assume that the array is non-empty and the majority element always exist in the array.

```
  [3,2,3] -> 3
  [2,2,1,1,1,2,2] -> 2
```

## Notes

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyer%E2%80%93Moore_majority_vote_algorithm

Basically if the result has to show up more than half of the time, then it always get chance to get corrected along the way if we are using a counter of latest majority.

```haskell
vote :: [Int] -> Int
vote [x] = x
vote [x:xs] = count xs 
```

## Code

```javascript
function vote(arr) {
  const n = arr.length

  let majority = null
  let counter = 0

  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    const j = arr[i]
    if (counter == 0) {
      majority = j
      counter++
    } else {
      if (j === majority) {
        counter++
      } else {
        counter--
      }
    }
  }
  return majority
}
```
